# test-framework

This is an automation framework I wrote for a Educational platform. 
The site is built with AngularJS so I had to use WebDriverWait almost everywhere in order to make
Selenium wait for angular to complete its scripts. I know that there is a tool called 
Protractor specifically designed to test Angular applications but I don't know javascript well enough
to be able to write a framework with it.
